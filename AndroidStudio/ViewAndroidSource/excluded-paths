# Default Idegen excluded paths file. Contains regular expressions, one per
# line, which match paths of directories and .jar files that should be excluded
# from the IDE configuration.
#
# We want to exclude as litte as possible by default, so it's important to
# document the reason for each exclusion.
#
# Developers can also create an 'excluded-paths' file in the project's root
# directory and add their own excludes to slim down their build.
#
# Currently, we lump all the .java files together into one big module, so you
# can't have two classes with the same name at once. In the future, we'll
# generate individual modules, each with their own dependencies, much like the
# build, so we won't have to worry about duplicate names any more than the
# build does.
#
# Note: Google-specific excludes go in vendor/google/excluded-paths.

# We don't currently support development tool source code. Development tools
# typically have their own IDE configurations anyway.

# The main problem is that the development tools are meant to run against a
# fully featured desktop VM while almost everything in our IDE configuration
# is meant to run against Android's more limited APIs. Mixing the two
# environments in one IDE configuration doesn't work well.
